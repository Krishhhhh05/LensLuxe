This project is focused on developing an API that leverages a machine learning model trained to detect various types of images. The model is capable of identifying:

- **Fake Images**: Images that have been manipulated or falsified.
- **AI-Generated Images**: Images created by artificial intelligence models.
- **Cartoon Images**: Images that are drawn or animated in a cartoon style.
- **Male/Female Images**: Images that classify the gender of individuals depicted.

The model was trained on a large dataset encompassing specific types of images to ensure high accuracy and reliability. The API documentation was meticulously crafted, and the API was successfully integrated, making it accessible for various applications.

# Features

- **Fake Image Detection**: Identifies images that have been altered or are deceptive.
- **AI-Generated Image Detection**: Recognizes images produced by AI models.
- **Cartoon Image Detection**: Detects cartoon or animated images.
- **Gender Classification**: Classifies images based on the gender of the individual depicted.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a comprehensive and diverse dataset, including various image types, to achieve robust performance across all detection tasks. The dataset includes:

- Real and fake images.
- AI-generated images.
- Cartoon-style images.
- Images with male and female individuals.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information on how to use the API, including:

- **Endpoints**: List of available endpoints and their functionalities.
- **Request Formats**: Details on the required input data formats.
- **Response Formats**: Explanation of the output data and its interpretation.
- **Authentication**: Information on securing API access.
- **Examples**: Sample requests and responses for quick reference.

## Integration

The API has been integrated into various systems, allowing for seamless interaction and utilization. It can be used in a wide range of applications, from content moderation to image verification and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Fake Image Detection API:

2. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the API documentation.
3. **Make a Request**: Start making requests to the API endpoints to detect different types of images.
4. **Integrate**: Incorporate the API into your application to enhance its capabilities.
